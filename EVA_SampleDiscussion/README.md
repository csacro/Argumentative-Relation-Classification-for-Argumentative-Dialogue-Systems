# EVA Sample Discussion
In our pipeline we queried ArgumenText for 70 arguments regarding the topic "nuclear energy is good" and
used the BERT model in combination with Traversing and Modifying Graphs to achieve
the argumentation structure in the .owl file.  
The .log file contains a sample discussion between two two artificial EVA-agents utilizing this .owl file as a database.
